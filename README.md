# MegaQuagga Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment

## 📌 Objective
Conducted an end-to-end network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment of the "MegaQuagga" environment. This project focuses on mapping the attack surface, enumerating services, and identifying misconfigurations in SMB, WMI, and LDAP protocols.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
* **Network Mapping:** Executed Nmap scans (Ping, Aggressive, and Script-based) to identify open ports and services.
* **Enumeration:** Performed deep-dives into SMB shares, LDAP user objects, and WMI system data.
* **Web Reconnaissance:** Used `ffuf` for directory discovery and analyzed web server banners for version leaks.
* **Remediation Verification:** Documented "Before vs. After" states for security fixes, specifically focusing on SMB version hardening and web server signature suppression.

## 📂 Project Files
* **`MegaQuagga-Scanning-Notes.pdf`**: Detailed technical notes documenting the reconnaissance process and key findings.
* **`MegaQuagga-Tool-Output.csv`**: Raw data output from all scanning tools, including Nmap, SMBEnum, and WMI queries.

## 🚀 Impact
This lab demonstrates technical proficiency in the reconnaissance phase of the Cyber Attack Lifecycle. By identifying and verifying the remediation of service-level vulnerabilities, this project showcases the "muscle memory" required for a Junior SOC Analyst or Pentester.
